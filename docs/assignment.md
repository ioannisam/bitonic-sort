- Write a distributed program that sorts $N$ integers in ascending order, using [`MPI`](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/). The inter-process communications should be defined by the *Bitonic sort* algorithm as presented in our class notes.

- The program must perform the following tasks:

    - The user specifies two positive integers $q$ and $p$.

    - Start $2^p$ processes with an array of $2^q$ random integers is each processes.

    - Sort all $N = \left ( 2^{(q + p)} \right)$ elements int ascending order.

    - Check the correctness of the final result.

- Your implementation should be based on the following steps:
    - Start `p` processes, each process gets `n/p` data and sorts (ascending or descending depending on the process id) them using `sort` from any library. Use two buffers, to sort from one to the other, to send from one and receive in the other.
    - Repeat O$((log_2(p))^2)$
         * Exchange data with the corresponding partner and keep the `min` or `max` elements, depending on the process id and phase of the computation
         * Sort locally the bitonic sequence using a modification of merge sort, starting from the "elbow" of the bitonic.   
- You may use the `C` standard library function `stdlib qsort()` to check the correctness of your results and as the initial local sorting routine for each process.

- **You must deliver:**
    - A report (about $3-4$ pages) that describes your parallel algorithm and implementation.

    - Your comments on the speed of your parallel program compared to the serial sort, after trying you program on `aristotelis` for $p = [1:7]$ and $q = [20:27]$.

    - The source code of your program uploaded online.

- **Ethics:** If you use code found on the web or by an LLM, you should mention your source and the changes you made. You may work in pairs; both partners must submit a single report with both names.
- **Deadline:** 7 January, $2025$.
